- Encoder Block 2: [1, 16, 64, 64, 16]

### Bridge
- Bridge Layer: [1, 32, 32, 32, 8]

### Decoder Path
- Decoder Block 2: [1, 16, 64, 64, 16]
- Decoder Block 1: [1, 8, 128, 128, 32]

Key features:
- 3D Convolutions
- Skip Connections
- Batch Normalization
- ReLU Activation
- Max Pooling for downsampling
- Transposed Convolutions for upsampling

## Dataset

The dataset used is Task02_Heart from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon, which includes:
- 3D cardiac MRI scans
- Ground truth segmentation masks
- Standardized preprocessing pipeline

## Training Process

### Training Parameters
- Epochs: 100
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy

Initial Training Loss: ~0.98
Final Training Loss: 0.9656
Final Validation Loss: 0.9631

Training showed steady improvement across epochs with the following characteristics:
- Consistent decrease in both training and validation loss
- No significant overfitting (validation loss tracks closely with training loss)
- Stable convergence pattern

## Results and Analysis

### Final Performance Metrics
- Training Loss: 0.9656
- Validation Loss: 0.9631
- Model Size: ~15MB

### Key Observations
